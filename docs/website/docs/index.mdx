Meteor is a simple framework that helps you to create application using the MVI architecture. It provides a robust structure for organizing your code and separating concerns. Additionally, Meteor integrates with Kotlin Coroutine that helps you to write asynchronous and concurrent code.

## Features

- Meteor follows the Model-View-Intent (MVI) architecture pattern.
- It provides a unidirectional data flow (UDF), allowing you to handle state changes and propagate them to the UI efficiently.
- Supports Kotlin Coroutines: asynchronous and concurrent code in a more concise and structured way.
- Meteor supports Kotlin Multiplatform, allowing you to share code across multiple platforms.
- Easy to test (integration and unit  tests).
- Additional features like common use cases, state flow, view model and logger.
<!-- - Effortless, customizable recording - use our built-in templates or record your own web UI -->


## Why Meteor?

Meteor simplifies application development by providing a clear structure and separation of concerns through the MVI architecture, making your codebase more maintainable and organized.

With Kotlin Multiplatform support, Meteor enables code sharing across different platforms, reducing duplication and maximizing code reuse, ultimately saving development time and effort.

Meteor's reactive state management mechanism simplifies the handling of application state. It enables you to manage state changes efficiently and ensures that your UI remains synchronized with the underlying data.

## Architecture

Model-View-Intent is an architectural pattern used in software development, particularly in user interface (UI) design. It is commonly applied in the context of reactive and functional programming paradigms.

The `MVI` pattern aims to provide a clear separation of concerns and a unidirectional data flow within an application.

                expect { state.copy(count = state.count - 1) }
            }
            CountWish.Increase -> {
                expect { state.copy(count = state.count + 1) }
            }
            CountWish.Reset -> {

            }
            CountWish.ZeroValue -> {
                effect {
                    CountEffect.Failure("The value is zero")
                }
            }
